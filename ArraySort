Ram has an array A
 which may or may not be in strictly increasing order. He wants to make this array increasing but does not wish to change the position of any element so he came with an idea that he will replace an element with any of its divisors i.e he changes an element X
 to M
 if X
 is divisible by M
.

Your task is to tell whether the given array A
 can be transformed to strictly increasing by performing the operation given above.

Input
The first line contains an integer N
 denoting length of the array A
.

The second line contains N
 space separated integers 1≤A[i]≤105
 where (0≤i<n)
Output
Print "YES" (without quotes) if the array can be transformed in the strictly increasing order else print "NO"(without quotes).

Examples
input
5
1 2 16 16 16
output
YES

4
1 3 8 4
output
NO
